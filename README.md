# Acknowledgement
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/).
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called AddressBook)
  used for managing contact details.
    * It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 6 KLoC) than what
      students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.
