**GoMedic is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using GoMedic, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing GoMedic, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to
  start.
