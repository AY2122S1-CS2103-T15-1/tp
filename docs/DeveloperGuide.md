## **Introduction**

![logo](images/logo.png)

GoMedic is a **cross-platform desktop application written in Java and designed for doctors and medical residents to
manage contacts and patient details**. We aim for GoMedic to be used by someone who can type fast and take advantage of the
optimized features for Command Line Interface.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of many Ui components e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SideWindow`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* listens for changes to `Model` activities, doctors and patients data so that the respective Ui table can be shown and can be updated with the modified data.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Doctor`, `Profile`, `Patient` and `Activities` object residing in the `Model`.

The original Figma design for the `UI` component can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/zqo6peKfu0Wxeay679eVq9/cs2103t-tp?node-id=0%3A1)

To display the correct table (i.e. `ActivityTable`, `PatientTable`, or `DoctorTable`) or `PatientView` page to be shown in the `MainWindow`. 
The `MainWindow` object also listens to the `ModelBeingShown` stored in the `Model` component. 

The following *Sequence Diagram* illustrates how the `UI` component interacted with other components to show 
the correct model to the user after the user enters `list t/patient` command.  

![UiPatient](images/ui/UpdateModel.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: 
**Note:** GoMedic implements Observer Pattern using `ObservableList` and `ObservableValue` provided by the `JavaFX` framework to update the Ui
</div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPatientCommand`
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a patient).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the
`execute("delete t/patient P001")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete t/patient P001` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePatientParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPatientParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPatientParser`, `DeletePatientParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/storage/Storage.java)

![Storage Component Class Diagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component handles the storing and loading of the data that GoMedic requires in order to function. 
These include user-created data, such as the patients, activities, doctors, and the user profile that is stored in GoMedic, 
as well as data related to the preferences and settings in GoMedic.

The `Storage` component makes use of the `Jackson` library to parse the data from GoMedic into a `JSON` format, and vice-versa.

* To load data from the user's hard disk, it parses the data stored in human-readable `json` files that reside in the `[JAR file location]/data/` directory. 
This directory is automatically created by GoMedic if it doesn't already exist (usually occurs during the first launch).
* To store data from GoMedic into these files, it parses important attributes of these data (e.g. for a doctor, important information 
would include the doctor's name, phone number and department) into a pre-defined `JSON` format. For doctors, this is defined 
in [`JsonAdaptedDoctor.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/gomedic/storage/JsonAdaptedDoctor.java).


In general, the role of the `Storage` component is to:
* Save both user-created data (which is abstracted as the **AddressBook**) and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* Make use of its inheritance from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage` to play the role either one, depending on
  context, and the necessary functions required of it. 

**Note:** To implement the `Storage` architecture, dependencies on some classes in the `Model` component, 
such as `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Activity` and `UserProfile` are required.
This is because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`, hence it would need
to access objects from these classes in order to acquire the necessary attributes from these objects to be stored. However,
note that we do not show these dependencies in the diagram above, in order to preserve the high-level design representation of
the `Storage` architecture, and to reduce unnecessary information overload.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `gomedic.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Suggestions feature

The suggestions feature is facilitated by `Messages`. It is a class consisting of static immutable string messages for 
various fixed error outputs for GoMedic. It implements the following operation:

* `Messages#getSuggestions(String command)` â€” Returns suggested commands within GoMedic based on the incorrect command
input.

Given below is a sequence diagram when a user provides an erroneous input, "adl t/patent".

![SuggestionsSequenceDiagram](images/SuggestionsSequenceDiagram.png)

### Generating Medical Referral Feature 

This feature allows GoMedic users to generate medical referral for a uniquely identified patient identified by his/her `PatientId` to other
doctor that is already saved in the GoMedic application and would be uniquely identified by his/her 
`DoctorId`.

This feature can be accessed using `referral` command which has parameters of `ti/Title`, `di/DoctorId`, `pi/PatiendId` and optional 
description which can be added using `d/Description` flag. 

_This feature uses **iText Java Pdf writer library** to generate the medical referral document._  

**Workflow**

For illustration purposes, suppose the user enters the command:

`referral ti/Referral of Patient A di/D001 pi/P001 d/He is having internal bleeding, need urgent attention.`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** the doctor id and patient id does not need to conform the `DXXX` and `PXXX` format in this case. However, should the supplied ids are invalid,
GoMedic would be unable to find the doctor and the patient, and would show the feedback patient/doctor not found message to the user.
</div>

Once the user enter the command is entered, the following **Sequence Diagram** below shows how the components specified in the [architecture](#architecture) interact with each other creates the new `ReferralCommand` object

![ReferralCommandCreation](images/referral/ReferralCommandCreation.png)

After the `LogicManager` receives the new `ReferralCommand` object, 

1. The `ReferralCommand` then would call the appropriate methods from the `Model` to obtain the `UserProfile`, DoctorList` and `PatientList`
2. Based on the illustration, `ReferralCommand` then would filter and check for the existence of patient whose id is `P001` and doctor whose id is `D001`.

Where the specific methods are shown in the sequence diagram shown below : 

![ReferralCommandCreation](images/referral/ReferralCommandExecution.png)

When the data is ready, the `ReferralCommand` object would call the `iTextPdf` library *APIs* that enable it to create a new Pdf document as shown 
in the sequence diagram below : 

![ReferralCommandWrite](images/referral/ReferralCommandWriteFile.png)

Finally, the pdf object is written into the `data/` folder whose filename is the same of that of the `title` (i.e. _title_.pdf). 
For this illustration, the file then would be `Referral of Patient A.pdf`.

### Customizing user's personal profile in GoMedic
This feature allows the user to customize his or her profile details on GoMedic. These details can then be used to 
sign off the referrals generated by the `referral` command. 

This feature can be accessed using the `profile` command. The user can customize these details through the parameters:
* `n/NAME` : The name of the user
* `p/POSITION`: The position held by the user
* `de/DEPARTMENT`: The department that the user works in
* `o/ORGANIZATION`: The organization that the user works in

Given below is the sequence diagram when a user provides an example of a valid `profile` command 
(`profile n/Jon Snow p/Senior Consultant de/Department of Neurology o/National University Hospital`)
to update his or her profile in GoMedic.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** The example below does not include the details of the creation of a `ProfileCommand` object, as the
implementation is similar to that of the example covered in the `ReferralCommand` above.
</div>

![ProfileSequenceDiagram](images/ProfileSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen in the diagram above, after the `LogicManager` receives the `ProfileCommand` object,

1. The `LogicManager` will call the `execute` method of `ProfileCommand`, passing in the `Model` as a parameter to the method.
2. The `ProfileCommand` will then create a new `UserProfile` object based on the details specified by the user in the command.
3. Then, `ProfileCommand` will call `Model#setUserProfile(updatedProfile)` to replace the existing user profile with the new one.
4. The `ProfileCommand` will create a `CommandResult` and return it to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` then calls `Model#getAddressBook()` to get the newly updated address book in the model.
6. Finally, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveAddressBook(addressBook)` to update the new user profile in the storage and returns
the `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user.

### View feature
This feature allows user to view patient's details as PatientTable does not show complete details of the patients.

This feature can be accessed using the `view` command, which currently only support the viewing of patient which follows
the following format `view t/patient PATIENT_ID` where `PATIENT_ID` is a valid id of a patient.

Given below is the sequence diagram when a user provides an example of a valid `view` command
(`view t/patient P001`) to see the complete details of the patient.

![ViewPatientCommand](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ViewPatientParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

As seen in the diagram above, when `view` command is made by the user, following steps happened inside the logic:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in `ViewPatientCommand` which will be executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. Then, `ViewPatientCommand` will call its own `getSpecifiedPatient()` that triggers the call of `Model#getFilteredPatientList()`
to get all patients in GoMedic and return the specific patientToView.
4. Next, `ViewPatientCommand` will call `Model#viewPatient(patientToView)` to set the details to be similar to the specified patient to be viewed.
5. The `ViewPatientCommand` will create a `CommandResult` and return it to `LogicManager`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to be run without any installation required as long as the user has Java `11` installed.
3. Should be able to hold up to 1000 patients and colleagues without a noticeable delay (less than 2 seconds) in
   performance for typical usage.
4. Should be able to hold up to 200 future activities and future appointments, and be retrieved without a noticeable
   delay (less than 2 seconds) for typical searches.
5. Should be only used by a single user and do not require other users to make changes to the app such as making
   appointment or sharing activities.
6. The data should not be stored using a _DBMS_.
7. The data should be stored _locally_ and should be in a human _editable_ and easily modified text file.
8. The project is expected to adhere to a _biweekly version release_ using breadth-first incremental technique.
9. Should be less than **100 MB** in size for the software, and less than **15 MB** per file for each document.
10. The developer guide and user guide must be pdf-friendly (meaning no embedded video, animations, embedded PowerPoint,
    etc.).
11. Should be delivered to the user using a single JAR file.
12. Graphical User Interface (GUI) should work reasonable well for standard screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 and higher
    with screen scales 100% and 125%, and also usable for screen resolutions 1280 x 720 and higher with screen scales
    150%.
13. Should be written mainly using Object-oriented paradigm.
14. The app is not required to be able to interact with external pieces of hardware such as printer.
15. The data stored within the app should be encrypted for security purposes (to prevent the raw data being read by
    external parties).
16. The app is mainly used for users based in Singapore, and therefore some local terms are tolerable, and the app is
    not expected to operate in other languages except English.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.
* **DBMS** : Database Management System such as MySQL, Oracle, PSQL, MongoDB, etc.
* **JAR** : Java Archive file format, which is typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata
  into one file for distribution.
* **Typical usage/searches** : Finding by keyword, name, medical histories, and any combination of the field manually.
* **Object-Oriented Paradigm** : programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than
  functions and logic. For complete list of Features that OO design should have,
  please [visit this wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Double-click the jar file. If you are unable to do so, you might need to run `java -jar gomedic.jar` from the terminal where the `gomedic.jar` file is located. Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be
       optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.
    
### Deleting an activity

1. Deleting an activity while all activities are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all activities using the `list t/activity` command. 
       Ensure at least 1 activity with id `A001` is there, otherwise please use `add t/activity` command to add a new activity. 
       Multiple activities will be displayed in a table sorted by its id.

    2. Test case: `delete t/activity A001`<br>
       Expected: Activity whose id `A001`. Details of the deleted contact shown in the feedback box. 

    3. Test case: `delete t/activity A001`<br>
       Expected: No activity is deleted. Error details shown in the feedback box. 

    4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete t/activity`, `delete t/doctor`, `delete t/activity x`, `...` (where x is an invalid id)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous for each patient, doctor and activity model.

### Finding a patient, doctor or activity
1. Searching for a doctor or a patient
    1. Prerequisite: List the patients, doctors, or activities based on which one you wish to see, using the `list` command.
    e.g. `list t/doctor` or `list t/patient` or `list t/activity`.
       
    2. Test case: e.g. `find t/patient n/Joe`
        Expected: All patients whose names contain the substring "Joe" (case-insensitive) will be displayed.
       
    3. Test case: e.g. `find t/activity ti/Meeting`
        Expected: All activities whose title or description contains the substring "Meeting" (case-insensitive) will be displayed. 
       
    4. Other incorrect find commands to try: `find t\patient Joe` 
        Expected: Error message as a flag is not specified prior to the keyword.
