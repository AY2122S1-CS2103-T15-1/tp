# **Introduction**

![logo](images/logo.png)

GoMedic is a **cross-platform desktop application written in Java and designed for doctors and medical residents to
manage contacts and patient details**. We aim for GoMedic to be used by someone who can type fast and take advantage of the
optimized features for Command Line Interface.

GoMedic is bootstrapped using SE-EDU Address Book 3 and inherits some of its features such as `clear`, parameter
formatting, etc.

# [**1. How To Use This Guide**](#table-of-contents)

This user guide provides information to assist you in using **GoMedic** based on which features you are most interested in. 
The user guide is sectioned such that each chapter [has](#table-of-contents) an 
* **Overview** : Explains what the feature does and provides some important reminders about the notations used in that particular chapter
* **Features** : List of commands available within that section 
  * **Format** : List of fields that need to be supplied for that particular command
  * **Parameters** : Explanation about each field, together with its constraints
  * **Examples** : Tutorial with pictures on how to use the commands. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:bulb: **Tip:** You can always go back to the table of content page and just click on which feature you are currently interested at, as each feature has a very comprehensive tutorial !
</div>

To get the most out of this user guide, it would be best to understand the terminologies and notations that would often be used in this user guide. 

Don't worry if you forget some [notations](#12-about-the-commands) along the way, you can always check this chapter or the **Overview** section to find 
the important notations that are used in that chapter. 

## [1.1 How GoMedic Looks Like](#table-of-contents)

![gomedic-design](images/ui/segmentation.png)

## [1.2 About the Commands](#table-of-contents)
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Understanding The Notations:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MEDICAL_CONDITION]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/diabetes`, `m/fever m/flu` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123` or `help x/123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  
* Any whitespaces inserted before and after the parameter value will be removed. <br>
  E.g. Let `\s` represent a whitespace. If parameter is specified as `p/\s\s98765432\s\s`, 
  the value will be treated as `98765432`, without the leading and trailing whitespaces.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## [1.3. Error Messages](#table-of-contents)

1. Should you enter an **invalid** command that **GoMedic** cannot recognize, **GoMedic** will
return some suggestions on the closest commands that you can choose from!

   * For example, as `list` command is not available, **GoMedic** will return you the closest commands available which are 
   `list t/acitivty`, `list t/patient`, and `list t/doctor`. 

    To understand more how the suggestion works, please refer to [this](#42-suggestions) section.

2. Should you enter a **valid** command that GoMedic recognizes, but in an **invalid** format (such as a command with missing parameters),
**GoMedic** would highlight the command in red and show the correct command usage in the feedback box. 

3. Should you enter a **valid** command in a **valid** format, but with invalid parameters, 
**GoMedic** would flag the invalid parameter in the feedback box.
   * Invalid parameters can be caused by constraints' violation, such as inputting blood type X for a patient, where such blood type does not exist.
   * If multiple parameters are invalid, GoMedic only flags the first invalid parameter so as to not overwhelm you with the error messages!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** To fix the multiple parameters' errors in a command, you can fix them one by one based on the feedback that **GoMedic** give and use the [navigation](#41-navigating-past-commands) feature to get the previous command!
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# [**2. Quick start**](#table-of-contents)

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `gomedic.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your GoMedic.

    * Double-click the file to start the app. If it's not possible, open the terminal and set the current directory to the directory that `gomedic.jar` resides in.
      Enter the command `java -jar gomedic.jar`. If you still find difficulties in opening the `gomedic.jar` file, please follow the steps [here](#5-faq)!
    * A GUI, similar to the one shown below, should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
      contains some sample data.<br>
      ![Ui-activity](images/Ui-activity.png)

4. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. E.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list t/patient`** : Lists all patients.

    * **`add t/patient n/John Doe a/30 g/M h/174 w/72 b/O p/12345678 m/heart-failure m/diabetes`** : Adds a patient
      named `John Doe` to GoMedic.

    * **`delete t/patient P001`** : Deletes the patient whose id is P001.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts including patients, doctors, and activities.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.
5. **Address Book, GoMedic Address Book, and GoMedic** refers to the same term, which is just the application itself.
6. Refer to the [Features](#3-gomedic-features) below for details of each command.

# [**3. GoMedic Features**](#table-of-contents)

## [**3.1 Patients Related Features**](#table-of-contents)

### [3.1.1 Overview](#table-of-contents)
Patients related features allow you to store, edit, view, and list patients.

Using patients, you can store your patients' details and track all medical conditions that your patients are
diagnosed with.

Each patient is **uniquely** identified by its `PATIENT_ID` in the form of `PXXX` where `XXX` is a 3-digit integer.
Therefore, two patients with exactly same `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `AGE`, `GENDER`, `HEIGHT`, `WEIGHT`, `BLOOD_TYPE`, 
and `MEDICAL_CONDITIONS` with different `PATIENT_ID` are considered distinct.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Reminder on Command Notation:**<br>

* Some important notation in reading the commands
    * `[flag/KEYWORD]` indicates optional parameters
    * `flag/KEYWORD` indicates mandatory parameters
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### [3.1.2 Adding a new patient: `add t/patient`](#table-of-contents)

Adds a new patient into your **GoMedic** application.

**Format**: `add t/patient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER a/AGE g/GENDER h/HEIGHT w/WEIGHT b/BLOOD_TYPE [m/MEDICAL_CONDITION]...`

**GoMedic** would create a new patient based on the smallest `PATIENT_ID` available.

<a name="patient_check"></a>

* GoMedic would check for any invalid parameters as specified [here](#patient_constraint). Should there be any, the new
patient will not be added.

The parameters are :

<a name="patient_constraint"></a>

### [3.2.1 Overview](#table-of-contents)

Doctor related features allow you to store, edit and list details of other doctors.

These could be details of your colleagues, or other acquaintances that are important in your work.

Each doctor is **uniquely** identified by his or her `DOCTOR_ID` in the form `DXXX`, where `XXX` is a 3-digit integer.
Therefore, **GoMedic** considers two doctors with the same details (same `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER` and `DEPARTMENT`), 
as two distinct and different doctors, as long as their `DOCTOR_ID`s are different.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

## [**3.3 Activities Related Features**](#table-of-contents)

### [3.3.1 Overview](#table-of-contents)

Activities related features allow you to add, delete, edit and list events and appointments with patients. 

Using activities, you can track down your daily, weekly or even monthly schedules. **GoMedic** will also automatically 
check for any conflicting activities and notify you immediately everytime you try to create a new activity or update 
an existing activity.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about the Time format:**<br>

* There are three accepted datetime formats (GMT+8 24-Hour Time format):
    1. dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm (e.g. 15/09/2022 13:00)
    2. dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm (e.g. 15-09-2022 13:00)
    3. yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm (e.g. 2022-09-15 13:00)
</div>

Each activity is **uniquely** identified by its `ACTIVITY_ID` in the form of `AXXX` where `XXX` is a 3-digit integer. 
Therefore, two activities with exactly same `TITLE` and `DESCRIPTION` with different `ACTIVITY_ID` are considered distinct.

---
**Current Activities Related Features That Are Not Supported by GoMedic**

* Creating and editing recurrent events. 
* Associating other doctors for an event.
* Listing the activity in a Calendar style. 

---

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Reminder on Command Notation:**<br>

* Some important notation in reading the commands
    * `[flag/KEYWORD]` indicates optional parameters
    * `flag/KEYWORD` indicates mandatory parameters
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### [3.3.2 Adding a new activity: `add t/activity`](#table-of-contents)

Adds a new activity into your **GoMedic** scheduler. 

**Format**: `add t/activity s/START_TIME e/END_TIME ti/TITLE [d/DESCRIPTION]`

**GoMedic** will create a new activity based on the smallest `ACTIVITY_ID` available. This example is shown [here](#appointment_tutorial), where
a new activity added is assigned the ID **A006** instead of **A008**. This means that this new activity is not displayed as the last entry in the list, 
as the table is sorted by `ACTIVITY_ID` by default.

<a name="activity_check"></a>

* GoMedic will check for any partial or full **conflicting activities** and notify you immediately if there are any. Should there be any,
the new activity will not be added. 
* GoMedic will also check for any invalid parameters as specified [here](#activity_constraint). Should there be any, the new activity will not be added. 

The parameters are:

<a name="activity_constraint"></a>

Parameters    |  Explanation                                      | Constraints                                          |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Extra Constraints** <br>

* `START_TIME` must be **strictly less** than `END_TIME`. 

* Activities with partially overlapping times are still considered as conflicting activities.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example:**

&#8291;1. Type the command `add t/activity s/2022-09-15 14:00 e/15/09/2022 15:00 ti/Meeting with Mr. X d/about a certain paper` into

### [3.3.3 Adding a new appointment: `add t/appointment`](#table-of-contents)

Adds a new appointment into your GoMedic scheduler.

**Format**: `add t/activity i/PATIENT_ID s/START_TIME e/END_TIME ti/TITLE [d/DESCRIPTION]`

An Appointment is a type of Activity, with an additional parameter `PATIENT_ID` associated with it. Currently, **GoMedic** only supports 
one-to-one appointments. Besides the [checks](#activity_check) performed on usual activity, **GoMedic** would also check
* if the Patient identified by his/her `PATIENT_ID` exists. If not, GoMedic will immediately notify the user and the new appointment will not be added
to the list. 

The parameters are:

## [**3.4. Finding entries**](#table-of-contents)

### [3.4.1 Overview](#table-of-contents)
The find feature allows you to search for entries based on user input by matching
the input string with the user-specified fields.

The model that is being searched must be specified too - doctor, patient or activity.

For all find functions, the Keyword is case-insensitive for convenience (“dia” will match diabetic patients even if the user stored the patient's
  condition as “Diabetes”)

The constraints of the field are not checked with the user input. For example, if the user enters
```find t/doctor p/hello```, GoMedic will not throw an error saying that phone number must be
8 digits only. GoMedic will simply display that there are no matching entries where the phone number
field in a doctor contains ```hello```. 

### [3.4.2 Finding a doctor through a keyword `find t/doctor`](#table-of-contents)

Searches for doctors whose specified field contains one or more of the specified keywords as a substring.

**Format**: `find t/doctor FIELD/[KEYWORDS]`

**GoMedic** will display the matching doctors.  

The possible parameters for FIELD are:

Parameters    |  Explanation                                      |

`de/DEPARTMENT` | Matches the department of the doctor           |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example:**

&#8291;1. Clear the entire doctor table using `clear t/doctor` and type the command `find t/doctor n/Hans Bo`. Since there are no doctors yet
(or whenever none of the doctors match the queries), the following page will be shown. 

![findEmpty](images/find/findEmpty.png)

&#8291;2. Now add 2 new doctors using `add t/doctor n/Hans Bo p/98765432 de/Cardiology` and `add t/doctor n/Yang Bo p/99991234 de/Dermatology`. 
Ensure they are added by using `list t/doctor` command. To find the doctor whose name contains "Hans", simply type the command `find t/doctor n/Hans` again. 
**GoMedic** would show number of matching records as shown in **1** and display them in the table as shown in **2**.

![findSuccess](images/find/findSuccess.png)

&#8291;3. If there is any invalid parameters supplied, for e.g. more than 2 fields are supplied,
**GoMedic** will make the commands turn red as shown in **1** and would display the feedback as shown in **2**.

--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
`n/NAME`      | Matches the full name of the patient              |
`p/PHONE_NUMBER`| Matches the phone number of the patient         | 
`a/AGE`         | Matches the age field                           |
`g/GENDER`    | Matches the gender of the patient                 | 
`h/HEIGHT`    | Matches the height of the patient in centimeters  | 
`w/WEIGHT`    | Matches the weight of the patient in kilograms    | 
`b/BLOOD_TYPE`| Matches the blood type of the patient             | 
`m/MEDICAL_CONDITION`| Matches the medical conditions of the patient | 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example:**
* ```find t/patient n/Hans Bo``` will return patients whose names are `Hans Gruber`, or `Bo Yang`.

`ti/TITLE`     | Matches the title field or description           |                            

**Example:**

&#8291;1. Clear the entire activity table using `clear t/activity` and type the command `find t/activity ti/Hans Bo`. Since there are no activities yet
(or whenever none of the activities match the queries), the following page will be shown.

![findEmpty](images/find/findActivityEmpty.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

&#8291;2. Now add 2 new activities using `add t/activity s/15/09/2022 14:00 e/15/09/2022 15:00 ti/team meeting d/CS2103t group discussion` and
`add t/activity s/14/09/2022 11:00 e/14/09/2022 12:00 ti/Lunch with CEO d/Lunch to discuss promotion`. To find the activity for team meeting, simply type
`find t/activity ti/team meeting`. **GoMedic** would show number of matching records as shown in **1** and display them in the table as shown in **2**.

# [**4. Tips and Tricks**](#table-of-contents)

## [4.1 Navigating Past Commands](#table-of-contents)

**GoMedic** is designed mainly for those who type fast and prefer inputting commands by typing them. 
However, typing commands repeatedly to fix small errors from previous commands can be frustrating. 

:bulb: **Tip:** You can navigate to your previous commands by pressing the up or down arrow keys!

Instead of typing the corrected command from scratch, you can press the up or down arrow keys to get the commands that you have entered previously, 
and modify them accordingly!

* The **up** arrow key allows you to go back to the previous command typed if any
* The **down** arrow key allows you to go forward to the next command typed if any 

If there are no more commands after the current command in the command box, **GoMedic** would clear the command box for you! 

**Examples:**

&#8291;1. Open the app and type `list t/patient` into the command box. The data shown in your table
might differ from the screenshots, depending on the data that is currently stored in your **GoMedic**.

![tut-navigate](images/navigate/navigation1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

&#8291;2. Press `Enter` and you would get the Patient table listed!

![tut-navigate](images/navigate/navigation2.png)

&#8291;3. To get the `list t/patient` command again, simply press **Up** arrow key in your keyboard, and you will get the `list t/patient` command
in your command box again!

![tut-navigate](images/navigate/navigation3.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## [4.2 Suggestions](#table-of-contents)

There are two types of erroneous inputs that we are expecting; One for single worded commands and one for two word commands.
Behaviour of each erroneous command is assumed to follow the convention specified above.

* Any mention of `{command}` refers to one of these values `add`, `delete`, `list`, `edit`, `clear`, `find`, `view`, `help`,
  `profile`, `referral`, `help`, `exit`
* `{type}` indicates one of these three values `t/activity`,`t/patient`, `t/doctor` and `{type}_id` means `ACTIVITY_ID` for `{type} = t/activity`

There will be **up to 5** suggested commands for each erroneous input.

1. **For errors that follow the format `{misspelt command}`**

   * errors such as `exi` will return `exit`,`edit t/patient`,`edit t/doctor`,`edit t/activity` ranked using a word similarity metric.

   * for such errors, single word commands like `help` or two word commands like `add t/patient` may be suggested.

2. **For errors that follow the format `{command} {misspelt type}`, `{misspelt command} {type}` or `{misspelt command} {misspelt type}`:**

   * errors such as `adl t/patit` will return `add t/patient`, `add t/activity` ranked using a word similarity metric.

   * for such errors, only two word commands like `add t/patient` can be suggested.

## [4.3 Saving the data](#table-of-contents)

GoMedic saves the data on the hard disk automatically after every command. There is no need to save manually. Currently, all the data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.

## [4.4 Editing the data file](#table-of-contents)

**GoMedic** allows advanced users to update the data stored at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, GoMedic will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
If the format for the user profile is invalid, the preset user profile will be used instead.

## [4.5 Reordering Columns in The Display Table](#table-of-contents)

:bulb: **Tip:** You can reorder the column to suit your preference by dragging the title, as shown by the following picture.

&#8291;1. Left click and hold any header of the table, the column would turn blue, indicating that it can be dragged.

![tut-reorder](images/activityug/tut_reorder_col.png)

&#8291;2. Drag the header into the location of other columns as indicated as **1**, the column would be inserted at the line indicated by **2**.

![tut-reorder2](images/activityug/tut_reorder_col2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

&#8291;3. Release the left click, and the columns should be reordered now!
